I assumed that the titled did not have to be left aligned. I looked up how to do it and it seems like it is possible but the title is usually handled by the OS.

On your first click, there may be an exception on the console output, however, the program works without flaw and still has all of its functionality. I donâ€™t know much about that exception as it is a thread exception but everything still works just fine so I just left it because the game still works properly.



Also, this program definitely contains more than 100 lines of code.
